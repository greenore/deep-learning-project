## README on notebook updates
- All updates are marked with [UPDATE]
- No changes in Milestones 1 and 2 
- Milestone 3: Added parameter tuning via cross-validation for random forest and kNN models. Generated new visualisations showing precision and recall of each model by genre. 
- Milestone 4: Added section exploring predicted probabilities from the CNN. Attempted to tune the optimal predicted probability thresholds for genre classification instead of using output layer.
- Milestone 5: New notebook showing our attempts to use alternative methods to train the network in a bid to improve its precision and recall. Methods attempted include multi-class classification, binary classification for each genre, and multi-label classification with equal sample sizes per class.
